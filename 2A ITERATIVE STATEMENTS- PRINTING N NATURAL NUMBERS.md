# Exp. No: 2a  
## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ PRINT NUMBERS FROM M TO N (INCLUSIVE)

###  Aim
To write a Python Program to print numbers  range from M to N (including M and N values)

###  Algorithm
1. Begin the program.
2. Use input() to read the values of M and N from the user.
3. Convert both inputs to integers.
4. Use a for loop to iterate from M to N (inclusive), and in each iteration, print the current value of i.
5. Terminate the program.

### ðŸ§¾ Program

```python
#REG NO: 212222220022
#NAME : MANIKANDAN R
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
for i in range(a,b+1):
    print(i,end="\n")
```

### RESULT
Thus a Python Program to print numbers  range from M to N (including M and N values) has been implemented successfulyy.
